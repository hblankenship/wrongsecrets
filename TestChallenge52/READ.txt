I added the binary file in the docker image and I can execute it but I can't use gdb on the process.
The binary file is not in the final container.
To test we have to build our own docker image with gdb on it, we use the Dockerfile.debug file to build a image then we push this image.
We can now attach a debug container to the main container.
Then we can use gdb -p <PID> and use print secret to get the secret.
I used a specific secret here for the test but later we will be able to use rand() to have a random secret.
Even with 1 in proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope and the process launched by the user wrongsecrets, I can't use gdb on it.
You can see the script in this directory where all commands are for the tests.
