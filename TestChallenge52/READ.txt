#Problem
I added the binary file in the docker image and I can execute it but I can't use gdb on the process.
The binary file is not in the final container.

Even with 1 in proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope and the process launched by the user wrongsecrets, I can't use gdb on it.(in the docker image and in the kubernetes container)

#Test
To test we have to build our own docker image with gdb on it, we use the Dockerfile.debug file to build a image then we push this image.
We can now attach a debug container to the main container.
Then we can use gdb -p <PID> and use p &secret to get the variable's memory address of secret.

I used a specific secret here for the test but later we will be able to use rand() to have a random secret.
You can see the script in this directory where all commands are for the tests.
